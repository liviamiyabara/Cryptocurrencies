Module 18: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the analysis

In this week's challenge, the student helps Martha, a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, a investment bank that wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its customers.

The raw data is provided for the study and the methods below are used for the unsupervised learning model:
* Preprocessing the database: cleaning up the data (i.e. dropping blank values, removing columns that are not needed) 
* Reducing the data dimension to 3 elements by using the Principal Component Analysis 
* Clustering data with the K-mean model
* Data visualization in 2D and 3D
